# Chess Server + UI
I love chess, and wanted to practice C++, so I made a simple frontend + game engine / game server.
Lots of features are missing (matchmaking, elo, cycle through moves of a game, etc.), but basic gameplay works.
I am aware that some of the code is ugly, and that there are a lot of things done incorrectly w.r.t idiomatic/performant C++. 


<b>Frontend</b> -> Typescript, React, Redux
<br>
<b>Backend</b> -> C++, BoostDI, [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib), [websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp)
<br>
