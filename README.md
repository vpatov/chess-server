# Chess Server + UI
I love chess so I made a simple frontend + game engine / game server.
Lots of features are missing (matchmaking, elo, cycle through moves of a game, etc.), but basic gameplay works.
Frontend -> Typescript, React, Redux
Backend = C++, BoostDI, [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib), [websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp)
